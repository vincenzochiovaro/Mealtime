# Mealtime

This is a simplified version of the MealDB API, designed to help beginners learn how to interact with APIs and create basic websites using programming languages. The goal of this project is to simplify the MealDB API response to include only the necessary information, making it easier for beginners to navigate and practice with.

# API Overview

The Simplified MealDB API is built using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. It retrieves data from the MealDB API and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. The API currently includes meal categories for chicken, pork, beef, and lamb.

# Getting Started

This section will be updated as soon as the endpoints have been created.
